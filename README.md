Hi all. This super deduper has been end of lifed. Don't fear though - SD lives on
in a new, maintained repo. https://github.com/ibest/HTStream . This new SD
is beautiful modern c++11. Also, you get a lot of additional programs for even
more qc. If you have any
concerns or questions, feel free to leave a issue or question on HTStream.


Thank you for all your support.

HTStream should be the same functionality as this Super Deduper (just faster and less memory). If you absolutely need this
old SD, you can run `git checkout 7c48db4757fd1e4eb46b23d169969ff3c1131c8a` and see the old code.
